# PPuga

## Dictionary school project

PPuga -- (eng. *BSon*) a parrot with particular inclination towards business studies. It lives in Cracow, knows many words connected with that topic, willingly shouts them all day all night. She is loved by students, whom she helps.

Her cage is built in Rails, as you can probably see. She grows step-by-step, and is supposed to be released free in late 2012 (hm, maybe not that late).
